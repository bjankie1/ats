Advanced Trading System
=====================================

Scala based trading system. The system aims to evaluate calculations based on downstream data (Ticks) producing decisions based
on aggregated data.

Basic flow:
# Tick
# Candles aggregation
## If intra-candle tick -> Update metrics with the tick
## Else update metrics with new candle
# Evaluate decisions rules based on current tick and metrics
# Push decisions for further evaluation (accounting)
# Estimate VaR
# Execute trading decision -> E*Trade API
